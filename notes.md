# How to persist a specific HDMI output

GNOME 40, PipeWire with the pipewire-pulse "adapter," and an NVIDIA GTX 970 card.

## Observations

I test for audio using `speaker-test -b1000`.

When audio is working through the HDMI for DELL U3415W, `pactl list sinks` reports:

- ALSA card 1
- ALSA device 7
- ALSA subdevice 0

After I disconnect the HDMI cable and re-connect it, the audio is _not_ working, and `pactl list links` reports:

- ALSA card 1
- ALSA device 3
- ALSA subdevice 0

What's interesting is that this sink is the only one listed. It happens to be the sink for the first HDMI output, which goes to another monitor. So at this point, I can't even select a different sink. How do I make available the sink that I need?

According to `pactl list sinks`, it looks like the card stays the same, but a different "profile" is chosen:

```

Later, I change to the working output in GNOME settings, confirm the audio output, and observe that a different profile is selected:

```sh
    Profiles:
        off: Off (sinks: 0, sources: 0, priority: 0, available: yes)
        output:hdmi-stereo: Digital Stereo (HDMI) Output (sinks: 1, sources: 0, priority: 5900, available: yes)

        pro-audio: Pro Audio (sinks: 7, sources: 0, priority: 1, available: yes)
    Active Profile: output:hdmi-stereo-extra1
```

After this change, `pactl list sinks` reports only a sink for the second HDMI output, which is the one I want.

## Hypothesis

I can control the sink that is available by default by controlling which profile is has the highest priority.

## Test

I disconnect the HDMI cable and re-connect it.
I verify that `speaker-test` outputs no audio.
I run `pactl set-card-profile "alsa_card.pci-0000_07_00.1" "output:hdmi-stereo-extra1"`.
I verify that `speaker-test` now outputs audio!

Now I need to make sure this profile is chosen whenever the HDMI cable is connected.

When I disconnect the HDMI cable, the profile becomes unavailable, and is no longer the default.
When I re-connect the HDMI cable, the default profile is not changed.

Options:
1. Change the priority of the profiles, so that the one I want is always chosen, if it is available.
2. Update the card profile in response to the HDMI cable being connected.
3. Something else?

I have no idea how to do (1). From what I read, it looks like PulseAudio profiles are opaque, and come entirely from ALSA.

> A card profile represents an opaque configuration set of a card, like an analog or digital mode. It defines the backend-specific configuration of the card, and the list of currently available device ports and devices.
>
> ALSA backend in PulseAudio automatically creates PulseAudio cards, card profiles, device ports, sources, and sinks:
>
> PulseAudio card profile is associated with a configuration set for an ALSA card. It defines a subset of ALSA devices belonging to a card, and so the list of available device ports, sources, and sinks.
>
> -- https://gavv.github.io/articles/pulseaudio-under-the-hood/

Looks like this is controlled by a card profile, described in https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Backends/ALSA/Profiles/.

I found a default set of profiles on disk, and upstream https://cgit.freedesktop.org/pulseaudio/pulseaudio/tree/src/modules/alsa/mixer/profile-sets/default.conf. There are some HDMI profiles that match by name, and the "HDMI 2" profile that I want to prioritize gets a lower priority from this default profile:

```ini
[Mapping hdmi-stereo]
description = Digital Stereo (HDMI)
device-strings = hdmi:%f
paths-output = hdmi-output-0
channel-map = left,right
priority = 9
direction = output

[Mapping hdmi-stereo-extra1]
description = Digital Stereo (HDMI 2)
device-strings = hdmi:%f,1
paths-output = hdmi-output-1
channel-map = left,right
priority = 7
direction = output
```

I think my best bet might be to write a custom profile for the NVidia card I have.

I also found something concerning in the alsa-state.service logs. Since I upgraded to Fedora 34, where Pipewire is used by default, ALSA complains about "UCM not supported" for all my cards. I don't know what this error implies. It might even be ["harmeless"](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/issues/1269#note_959456).

## Plan

1.  Create udev rule

    I'm not sure what the rule should be for. Here are the udev events when I disconnect and re-connect the HDMI cable.

    ```sh
    > udevadm monitor
    monitor will print the received events for:
    UDEV - the event which udev sends out after rule processing
    KERNEL - the kernel uevent

    KERNEL[21656.741995] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:07:00.0/drm/card0 (drm)
    UDEV  [21656.743693] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:07:00.0/drm/card0 (drm)
    KERNEL[21656.928907] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:07:00.0/drm/card0 (drm)
    UDEV  [21656.929548] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:07:00.0/drm/card0 (drm)
    KERNEL[21660.487555] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:07:00.0/drm/card0 (drm)
    UDEV  [21660.488870] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:07:00.0/drm/card0 (drm)
    KERNEL[21660.674474] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:07:00.0/drm/card0 (drm)
    UDEV  [21660.675092] change   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:07:00.0/drm/card0 (drm)
    ```

    Here's how to discover the attributes of the card:

    ```sh
    > udevadm info --attribute-walk -p  /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:07:00.0/drm/card0

    Udevadm info starts with the device specified by the devpath and then
    walks up the chain of parent devices. It prints for every device
    found, all possible attributes in the udev rules key format.
    A rule to match, can be composed by the attributes of the device
    and the attributes from one single parent device.
